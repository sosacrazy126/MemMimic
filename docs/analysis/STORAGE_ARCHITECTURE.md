# MemMimic Storage Architecture - Post-Migration

## Overview

MemMimic has completed its migration to a clean, high-performance architecture:

**AMMS Storage** - Simplified, high-performance single system

The migration is complete. Legacy storage systems have been removed for simplicity.

## AMMS Storage (Current Architecture)

**Clean, single-system architecture**

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Simplified single-system architecture  
- ✅ High-performance async operations
- ✅ Optimized SQLite with indexing
- ✅ Built-in performance monitoring
- ✅ Clean Memory object model
- ✅ No migration overhead

## Usage

### Basic MemMimic API
```python
from memmimic import create_memmimic

# Create MemMimic instance (uses AMMS storage)
api = create_memmimic("memories.db")

# Store a memory (async)
memory_id = await api.remember("Important information")

# Search memories (async) 
results = await api.recall_cxd("search query")

# Get system status (async)
status = await api.status()
print(f"Storage type: {status['storage_type']}")  # 'amms_only'
print(f"Total memories: {status['memories']}")
```

### Direct Storage Access
```python
from memmimic import create_amms_storage, Memory

# Create storage directly
storage = create_amms_storage("memories.db")

# Create and store memory
memory = Memory("Important information")
memory_id = await storage.store_memory(memory)

# Search memories
results = await storage.search_memories("query", limit=10)

# List recent memories
recent = await storage.list_memories(limit=50)

# Get performance stats
stats = storage.get_stats()
print(f"Average response time: {stats['metrics']['avg_response_time_ms']:.2f}ms")
```

## Performance

- **Response Time**: Typically <10ms for search operations
- **Storage**: Optimized SQLite with proper indexing
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead, efficient object model
- **Async**: Fully async API for high throughput

## API Changes

**Note**: The API now uses async methods for memory operations:

```python
# OLD (no longer available)
memory_id = api.remember("content")
results = api.recall_cxd("query") 

# NEW (current)
memory_id = await api.remember("content")
results = await api.recall_cxd("query")
status = await api.status()
```

## Configuration

```python
# Simple configuration
storage = create_amms_storage("memories.db")

# The storage automatically handles:
# - Database initialization
# - Index creation  
# - Performance monitoring
# - Connection management
```

## Monitoring

```python
# Get storage statistics
stats = storage.get_stats()

# Returns:
{
    'storage_type': 'amms_only',
    'metrics': {
        'total_operations': 1234,
        'successful_operations': 1230,
        'failed_operations': 4,
        'avg_response_time_ms': 8.5
    },
    'db_path': 'memories.db'
}
```

## Migration Complete

The system has successfully migrated from the original MemoryStore to the high-performance AMMS storage. The architecture is now:

- **Simpler**: Single storage system, no complexity
- **Faster**: Optimized for performance  
- **Cleaner**: Removed migration scaffolding and legacy code
- **Async**: Modern async/await API

The user's feedback was correct - after migration, there's no need for dual systems. We now have a clean, single-system architecture that provides the best performance without unnecessary complexity.
