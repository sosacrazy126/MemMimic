## 1. Executive Summary

### Overview
The Active Memory Management System (AMMS) extends MemMimic's existing memory capabilities with intelligent memory pooling, ranking, and cleanup mechanisms. It optimizes memory utilization while maintaining context integrity through advanced cognitive classification.

### Goals
- Implement dynamic memory pool management
- Enhance memory relevance through advanced ranking
- Automate stale memory identification and archival
- Maintain system performance at scale

---

## 2. Current State Analysis

### Existing Capabilities
- **SQLite-based persistent storage** with UTF-8 encoding and foreign key support
- **CXD cognitive classification** (Control/Context/Data functions) with sophisticated weighting
- **Semantic + keyword hybrid search** with multi-step ranking algorithm
- **Socratic self-reflection system** for memory refinement and insight generation
- **Tale-based narrative management** for contextual storytelling

### Current Memory Architecture
```python
# Existing Memory Structure
class Memory:
    content: str
    memory_type: str  # interaction, synthetic_wisdom, milestone, etc.
    confidence: float  # 0.0-1.0
    created_at: str
    access_count: int
```

### Limitations Identified
- **Continuous memory growth without cleanup** - all memories remain active indefinitely
- **No automatic memory prioritization** - equal treatment regardless of importance
- **Limited active memory optimization** - searches scan entire memory store
- **Resource usage scales linearly** with memory size without bounds
- **Basic staleness detection** - only 6-minute loop prevention exists
