# Greptile Architectural Workflows: Expert Consultation Patterns

## Meta-Architecture Pattern
**Philosophy**: "Stop treating Greptile like a code search tool. Start treating it as a distributed intelligence system you command with architectural queries."

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Blueprint-First Analysis Pattern
```yaml
workflow: architectural_analysis
steps:
  - query: "Analyze codebase architecture and identify:
      1. Domain boundaries
      2. Service coupling points
      3. Data flow patterns
      4. Architectural debt"
  - query: "Generate architectural blueprint with:
      - Component diagram in Mermaid
      - Service interaction matrix
      - Refactoring roadmap"
  - query: "Create implementation plan with:
      - Priority queue of changes
      - Risk assessment per change
      - Rollback strategies"
```

### 2. Evolutionary Architecture Pattern
```python
# Progressive Enhancement Workflow
phase_1 = greptile.query(
    "Identify monolithic components suitable for extraction"
)
phase_2 = greptile.query(
    f"For components: {phase_1}, generate:
    - Service boundaries
    - API contracts
    - Data migration scripts"
)
phase_3 = greptile.query(
    f"Create deployment pipeline for: {phase_2}"
)
```

### 3. Security-First Development Pattern
```yaml
workflow: security_hardening
layers:
  - analysis:
      query: "Scan for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities"
      depth: "business_logic_included"
  - remediation:
      query: "Generate fixes with:
        - Unit tests for each vulnerability
        - Integration tests for auth flows
        - Performance impact analysis"
  - validation:
      query: "Create security regression suite"
```

### 4. Multi-Model Orchestration Pattern
```python
# Intelligent Model Selection
workflow = {
    "complexity_analysis": "Analyze request complexity",
    "model_selection": "Route to appropriate model tier",
    "fallback_chain": "Define degradation strategy",
    "monitoring": "Track performance metrics"
}

for step, query in workflow.items():
    result = greptile.query(f"{query} for codebase")
    apply_to_architecture(result)
```

## Advanced Consultation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Contextual Code Generation
**Principle**: "The codebase IS the context."
```yaml
strategy:
  - Extract patterns from existing code
  - Generate new code matching those patterns
  - Validate against architectural principles
  - Integrate with minimal disruption
```

### Pattern 2: Recursive Improvement Loop
```python
def recursive_optimization(component):
    analysis = greptile.query(f"Analyze {component} for optimizations")
    improvements = greptile.query(f"Generate improvements: {analysis}")
    validation = greptile.query(f"Validate improvements: {improvements}")
    
    if validation['score'] > threshold:
        apply_improvements(improvements)
        return recursive_optimization(component)  # Recurse
    return component
```

### Pattern 3: Distributed Intelligence Architecture
```yaml
architecture:
  orchestrator:
    role: "Route queries to specialized agents"
    implementation: "Greptile-powered dispatcher"
  
  specialist_agents:
    - security_analyst: "OWASP-focused analysis"
    - performance_optimizer: "Bottleneck identification"
    - architecture_validator: "Pattern compliance"
    - test_generator: "Coverage expansion"
  
  feedback_loop:
    mechanism: "Results feed back to orchestrator"
    learning: "Improve routing over time"
```

## Expert Consultation Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery
```
greptile.query("
  Perform comprehensive discovery:
  1. Map entire codebase structure
  2. Identify architectural patterns
  3. Detect anti-patterns
  4. Generate complexity heatmap
")
```

### Phase 2: Analysis
```
greptile.query("
  Deep architectural analysis:
  1. Service boundaries and coupling
  2. Data flow and dependencies
  3. Performance bottlenecks
  4. Security vulnerabilities
  5. Technical debt quantification
")
```

### Phase 3: Solution Design
```
greptile.query("
  Generate solution architecture:
  1. Target state architecture
  2. Migration path from current to target
  3. Risk mitigation strategies
  4. Implementation phases
  5. Success metrics
")
```

### Phase 4: Implementation Generation
```
greptile.query("
  Create implementation artifacts:
  1. Service scaffolding code
  2. API specifications
  3. Database migration scripts
  4. CI/CD pipeline configs
  5. Monitoring and alerting setup
")
```

## Architectural Decision Records (ADR) Pattern
```yaml
workflow: adr_generation
for_each_decision:
  - context: "Query current state and constraints"
  - options: "Generate alternative approaches"
  - analysis: "Compare trade-offs"
  - recommendation: "Select optimal path"
  - implementation: "Generate code changes"
```

## Performance Optimization Workflow
```python
# Iterative Performance Enhancement
while performance < target:
    bottlenecks = greptile.query("Identify performance bottlenecks")
    solutions = greptile.query(f"Generate optimizations for: {bottlenecks}")
    impact = greptile.query(f"Predict performance impact: {solutions}")
    apply_highest_impact(solutions, impact)
    performance = measure_performance()
```

## Cognitive Enhancement Patterns

### Meta-Learning Architecture
```yaml
pattern: self_improving_analysis
components:
  - pattern_extractor: "Learn from codebase patterns"
  - query_optimizer: "Improve query effectiveness"
  - result_validator: "Verify improvement quality"
  - feedback_integrator: "Update analysis strategies"
```

### Hierarchical Analysis
```
Level 1: Project-wide architectural analysis
Level 2: Service-level deep dives
Level 3: Component-specific optimization
Level 4: Method-level refinement
Level 5: Line-by-line enhancement
```

## Integration Patterns

### 1. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
on_pull_request:
  - greptile: "Analyze PR for architectural compliance"
  - greptile: "Generate missing tests"
  - greptile: "Suggest performance optimizations"
  - greptile: "Security vulnerability scan"
```

### 2. Real-time Development Assistant
```python
# IDE Integration Pattern
while coding:
    context = get_current_file_context()
    suggestions = greptile.query(f"
        Based on context: {context}
        Suggest:
        1. Next logical implementation
        2. Potential bugs
        3. Better patterns
    ")
    display_inline(suggestions)
```

## Principle-Driven Consultation

### The Big Three for Greptile
1. **Context**: The entire codebase is your context
2. **Query**: Architectural questions yield architectural answers
3. **Iteration**: Each query builds on previous insights

### Hierarchy of Greptile Leverage
1. **Principles**: Architectural patterns > Code snippets
2. **Queries**: System-level > Component-level > Line-level
3. **Applications**: Generation > Analysis > Search

## Signature Consultation Patterns

### "The Query IS the Architecture"
When you query Greptile architecturally, it responds architecturally.

### "First, we analyze. Then, we generate."
Understanding precedes creation in Greptile workflows.

### "Patterns scale, searches don't."
Extract patterns, not just code matches.

## Expert Tips

1. **Chain Queries**: Build complex understanding through query sequences
2. **Request Artifacts**: Always ask for concrete deliverables (code, configs, docs)
3. **Validate Recursively**: Use Greptile to validate its own outputs
4. **Think Architecturally**: Frame problems as system-level challenges
5. **Embrace Automation**: Generate entire workflows, not just code snippets

## Conclusion

Greptile architectural workflows transform it from a code analysis tool into a comprehensive architectural consultant. By following these patterns, you command a distributed intelligence system that understands, designs, and implements at scale.

**Remember**: You're not querying a database; you're consulting an architectural oracle. Frame your questions accordingly, and receive wisdom proportional to your ambition.
