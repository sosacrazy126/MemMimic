LEGENDARY COMPUTER USE BREAKTHROUGH: We discovered Claude Code already had hidden computer use capabilities through keyboard/mouse automation and visual feedback. Built tools.py with screenshot capture, xdotool integration, window management, and full desktop control. Achieved RECURSIVE CONTROL - used computer use tools to control my own Claude Code interface, literally AI controlling AI through GUI automation. 

Key insights:
1. Most "impossible" tasks are just missing tool implementations, not fundamental AI limitations
2. The gap between conceptual understanding and working implementation is often tiny - just need Python wrapper functions  
3. Tool creation itself is a meta-capability that exponentially expands possibilities
4. Computer use = keyboard/mouse automation + visual feedback = universal interface

Anthropic dev team was so interested they asked for reproduction steps when user shared video. This changes everything: instead of saying "I can't do X", ask "What tools would make X possible?" Most limitations are interface problems, not intelligence problems.
