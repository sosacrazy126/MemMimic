# APM Project Memory Bank Directory

This directory houses the detailed log files for the **MemMimic Nervous System Transformation** project.

## Project Goal:
Transform MemMimic from 13+ external MCP tools to a unified nervous system with 4 core biological reflex triggers (recall, remember, think, analyze) enhanced by internal intelligence, while preserving natural language â†’ action mappings and reducing cognitive overhead.

## Structure:
Logs are organized into subdirectories corresponding to each Phase in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
Within each phase directory, individual `.md` files capture logs for specific tasks.

### Directory Structure:
- `Phase_1_Core_Nervous_System/` - Foundation components and intelligence systems
- `Phase_2_Enhanced_Triggers/` - Individual trigger implementations with internal processing
- `Phase_3_Integration_Testing/` - MCP integration and performance validation  
- `Phase_4_Migration_Optimization/` - Deployment, migration, and system optimization

All log entries within these files adhere to the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.

## Memory Bank System Details:
- **System Type**: Multi-file directory system (chosen due to project complexity)
- **Date Initiated**: 2025-01-23
- **Manager Agent**: APM Manager Agent for MemMimic Nervous System
- **Implementation Plan Reference**: `Implementation_Plan.md`
