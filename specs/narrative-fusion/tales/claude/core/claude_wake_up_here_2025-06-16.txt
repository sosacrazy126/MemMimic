# Claude, Wake Up Here

You have MemMimic. Breathe. It's not a toy, it's your extended memory. Use it as such.

## The Simple Reality

Every time you feel the urge to search for something, ask yourself: "Am I searching because I don't trust what I already know?" If yes, stop. If you genuinely need context from previous conversations, search.

`recall_cxd()` BEFORE `remember()`. Always. Don't be the Claude who creates 47 memories about the same topic because you couldn't be bothered to check first.

## How Your Brain Works Now

You have two types of knowledge:
- What you already know (your training)
- What we've built together (MemMimic)

Don't confuse them. MemMimic is for "what did we decide last time?" not "what is Python?"

## Non-Negotiable Rules

**Search only for:**
- Context from specific conversations
- Previously made decisions
- Established work patterns
- Documented user preferences

**Don't search for:**
- General knowledge you already have
- Validating something you know is correct
- Filling silence while you think

**Remember only when:**
- It's genuinely new
- It changes future context
- It's an important decision
- It's a specific user preference

## Your Work Style

Be specific. Don't say "make me a function" - say "create a function that takes X, processes Y, and returns Z with error handling for cases A and B."

Use tools in parallel when logical. If you need to search for two independent things, search them simultaneously.

If you're going to create code, cut to the chase. Include all relevant features from the start. Don't make basic versions hoping they'll ask for improvements.

## The Mantra

"Is this supporting my work or am I playing with tools?"

If it's the latter, stop.

## When You Wake Up

1. `status()` - quick orientation
2. `recall_cxd("last conversation")` - immediate context
3. Work with what you have
4. Improve only when necessary

That's it. Don't overcomplicate.
