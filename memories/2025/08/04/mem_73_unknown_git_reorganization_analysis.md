# Memory 73

Git Reorganization Analysis - Documentation Library:
VERDICT: SUCCESSFUL REORGANIZATION (not deletion)
- 473+ files show as "D" because they were MOVED to new locations
- Verified key moves: .claude → _system/claude_config, ai_tools → dev_tools, consciousness → _archive
- Created new structure: 7 main directories with clear organization
- Added: navigation indexes, modular CLAUDE.md, README files
- Impact: Clean separation of dev docs from consciousness research, practical focus achieved
- Pattern: Use git mv in future to show moves vs delete+add
