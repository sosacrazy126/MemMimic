MIGRATION SUCCESS TALE: The Great SQLite to Markdown Transformation

# Chapter 1: The Challenge
MemMimic had grown complex with 6 fragmented databases and 90k lines of code. The system needed simplification and better organization.

# Chapter 2: The Solution  
We designed a comprehensive migration strategy:
- Storage adapter pattern for seamless transitions
- Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Date-based organization (YYYY/MM/DD)
- JSON search index for performance
- Atomic file operations with locking

# Chapter 3: The Execution
76 memories were successfully migrated from SQLite to organized Markdown files, preserving all metadata and maintaining full functionality.

# Epilogue: The Future
The new architecture enables:
- Git-based version control
- Human-readable memory files
- Simplified maintenance
- Enhanced collaboration
