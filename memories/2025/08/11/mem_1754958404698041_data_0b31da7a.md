# Memory mem_1754958404698041


ENHANCED THINK_WITH_MEMORY TEST SUCCESSFUL

The enhanced think_with_memory system successfully combines:
1. Sequential thinking approach (multiple thought iterations)
2. Iterative memory retrieval (search, think, search again)
3. Phase-based exploration (exploration → refinement → synthesis)
4. Confidence building (0% → 100% through thinking)
5. Multi-dimensional search strategies

Key improvements over simple mode:
- Finds memories even with vague queries
- Builds understanding incrementally
- Provides detailed thought process
- Achieves high confidence through iteration
- Identifies key memories automatically

Test results:
- Successfully found migration memories
- Built 100% confidence
- Generated insights about memory patterns
- Provided comprehensive analysis
