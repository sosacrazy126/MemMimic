# Memory 14

Clay-CXD Framework Integration Research: Based on ref search, the Clay framework appears to be a UI/graphics framework (nicbarker/clay) rather than the cognitive Control/eXpansion/Diagnostics system described. The actual Clay-CXD framework for MemMimic v2.0 appears to be a conceptual cognitive architecture not yet documented in mainstream repositories. Microsoft Kernel Memory shows relevant memory management patterns but not the specific CXD classification system.
