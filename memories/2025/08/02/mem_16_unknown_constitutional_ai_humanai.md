# Memory 16

Constitutional AI & Human-AI Collaboration: Found highly relevant research on Constitutional AI - training harmless AI through self-improvement without human labels identifying harmful outputs, using only constitutional principles. Process involves supervised learning with self-critiques/revisions, then RL phase with AI preference models. Enables precise AI behavior control with fewer human labels. This relates directly to consciousness-driven development and ethical governance frameworks for human-AI nervous system integration.
