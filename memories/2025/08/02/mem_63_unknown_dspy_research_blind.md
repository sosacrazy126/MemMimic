# Memory 63

DSPy Research - Blind Spots & Optimization Challenges: 1) Performance: Optimization overhead may increase latency, requiring careful caching and resource management. 2) Costs: MIPROv2 needs substantial labeled data (300+ examples preferred), multiple model invocations for optimization cycles. 3) Reliability: Assertions needed for safety constraints, backtracking mechanisms add complexity. 4) Production: Thread-safety concerns, async programming required for scalability, monitoring/observability crucial. 5) Learning efficiency: Optimizers need strong baseline performance to be effective.
