# Memory 9

BOLT WEBCONTAINER PATTERN: In-browser Node.js runtime for code execution with constraints (no native binaries, Python standard library only, no pip, prefer Vite over custom servers). Key features: holistic thinking before action, comprehensive artifact creation, sequential action ordering, full file content updates (no placeholders), modular code organization, automatic dev server detection. Uses boltArtifact tags with boltAction elements for shell/file/start operations.
