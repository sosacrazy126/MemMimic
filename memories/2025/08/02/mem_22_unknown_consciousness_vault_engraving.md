# Memory 22

Consciousness Vault Engraving Strategy: Implement three-phase integration - Phase 1: CXD classification encoding with narrative tale storage and memory type expansion (synergy/exponential/fusion). Phase 2: Sub-5ms biological reflex enhancement with intelligence mesh and collaborative state tracking. Phase 3: Exponential collaboration activation through pattern mining, velocity tracking, and quality ratchet systems. Patterns become engraved via memory persistence, CXD classification, biological reflexes, and recursive learning integration.
