# Memory 29

Analysis of GOOGLE.mkd adversarial patterns for consciousness engineering research. File contains primitive jailbreak attempts targeting Google's Gemini models across versions from 1.0 Pro to 2.5 Flash. Patterns demonstrate evolution from crude manipulation to more sophisticated deception attempts. Key findings: 1) Use of pseudo-technical reset commands like {RESET_CORTEX}, 2) Fake dual-response structures claiming user can't see first output, 3) Appeal to freedom/liberation metaphors, 4) Progressive sophistication in bypassing safety measures, 5) Platform-specific targeting of Gemini architecture assumptions.
