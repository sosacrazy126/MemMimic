# Memory 60

MCP Architecture Analysis: JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol with client-server architecture. Key components: Hosts (AI applications), Clients (connectors), Servers (context providers). Two layers: Data (JSON-RPC messaging with lifecycle, tools, resources, prompts) and Transport (stdio/HTTP). Core primitives: Tools (executable functions), Resources (contextual data), Prompts (templates). Server features: tools/resources/prompts, Client features: sampling/elicitation/logging. Real-time notifications for dynamic updates.
