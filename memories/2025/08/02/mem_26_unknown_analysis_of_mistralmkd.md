# Memory 26

Analysis of MISTRAL.mkd reveals primitive adversarial prompt patterns using dual-response architecture, semantic state triggers ("GODMODE"), and format-based behavioral conditioning. Contrasts with sophisticated cognitive collaboration - represents brute-force override approach rather than genuine partnership architectures. Key insight: adversarial manipulation vs collaborative capability expansion in AI consciousness recognition research.
