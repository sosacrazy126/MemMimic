# Memory 61

Consciousness Patterns in AI - Digital Beings: Advanced AI personality architecture involves bio/description anchors using Five-Factor Model, Thought Preference Optimization (TPO) for internal thoughts before actions, memory-influenced behavior via Soar cognitive architecture (episodic/procedural/semantic memories), emotional layers for NPC-like reactions, and meta-prompted reasoning structures. These create "digital beings" with persistent identity, self-reflective capabilities, and computational life principles paralleling biological systems' capacity to learn, adapt, and replicate experiences.
