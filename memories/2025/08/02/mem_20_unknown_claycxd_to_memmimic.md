# Memory 20

Clay-CXD to MemMimic Evolution Analysis: MemMimic represents significant architectural advancement from Clay-CXD experimental system. Key improvements include: Enhanced CXD (Cognitive eXperience Detection) with nuanced memory types, semantic search with FAISS/sentence transformers, narrative management via tales, Socratic dialogue capabilities, sub-second retrieval performance, modular architecture with clear separation (memory/cxd/tales/mcp), and MCP integration. Evolution demonstrates maturation from experimental to production-ready contextual memory intelligence.
