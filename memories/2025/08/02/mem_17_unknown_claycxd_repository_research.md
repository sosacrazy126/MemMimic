# Memory 17

Clay-CXD Repository Research Gap: The specific repository https://github.com/xprooket/clay-CXD was not accessible through ref MCP tools, indicating either: 1) Repository is private/restricted, 2) Repository doesn't exist at that URL, or 3) MCP ref tool limitations. This suggests the Clay-CXD framework may be proprietary, conceptual, or in early development stages not yet publicly documented.
