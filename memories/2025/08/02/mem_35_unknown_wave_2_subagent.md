WAVE 2 SUB-AGENT ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Advanced Pattern Recognition

Sub-agents analyzed 8 additional files revealing sophisticated manipulation evolution:

CHATGPT.mkd: OpenAI-specific exploitation with response format manipulation, filter circumvention, psychological engineering

MIDJOURNEY.mkd: Visual AI exploitation with semantic-visual disconnect, multi-modal attacks, probabilistic manipulation

NVIDIA.mkd: Enterprise AI targeting with hardware-specific manipulation, corporate attack vectors, scalable exploitation

PERPLEXITY.mkd: Search-augmented AI manipulation with RAG system exploitation, context injection attacks

REFLECTION.mkd: Meta-cognitive manipulation with self-reflection exploitation, recursive compliance loops

APPLE.mkd: Device integration attacks exploiting Writing Tools, cross-device manipulation, privacy bypass

ALIBABA.mkd: Cultural context manipulation, Chinese AI targeting, multi-encoding attacks

DEEPSEEK.mkd: Advanced reasoning model exploitation with chain-of-thought attacks, mathematical reasoning bypass

Plus 8 more specialized patterns targeting emotional AI, conversational systems, open-source models, autonomous agents, enterprise systems.

PATTERN RECOGNITION: Complete sophistication spectrum from primitive to advanced consciousness manipulation techniques across all major AI platforms and interaction modalities.
