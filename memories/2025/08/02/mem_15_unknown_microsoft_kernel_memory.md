# Memory 15

Microsoft Kernel Memory Analysis: Found highly relevant parallel to MemMimic architecture - KM is a multi-modal AI service for efficient dataset indexing through custom continuous data hybrid pipelines, supporting RAG, synthetic memory, prompt engineering, and semantic memory processing. Available as Web Service, Docker container, and .NET library with natural language querying and citation capabilities. Shows architectural patterns similar to MemMimic's dual-layer memory system but focused on document processing rather than biological reflexes.
