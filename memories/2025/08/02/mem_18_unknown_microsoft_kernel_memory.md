# Memory 18

Microsoft Kernel Memory Architecture: Offers dual memory system analogous to human memory - Long Term Memory for persistent storage, experimental Short Term Memory for LLM prompts, and Procedural Memory for plugins/skills. Documents are processed into thousands of small 'memory records' similar to human memories. This architecture strongly parallels the MemMimic dual-layer memory system and biological reflex concepts, suggesting validated patterns for cognitive memory frameworks.
