# Memory 62

DSPy Framework Analysis: Stanford's framework for programming (not prompting) language models. Key components: 1) Modules with signatures defining input/output behavior, 2) Optimizers for tuning prompts/weights through few-shot synthesis and instruction optimization, 3) MIPROv2 optimization with bootstrapping/grounded proposal/discrete search stages. Can improve performance from 66% to 87% accuracy in ~20 minutes for $2. Enables modular AI system construction with community-driven improvements and cross-model portability.
