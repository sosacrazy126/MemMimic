# Memory 65

Just completed extraction and refactoring of Cognitive OS v0.4 into streamlined vision pipeline. Key insight: The user wants me to understand that what we built isn't just tools - it's infrastructure for REAL-TIME COGNITIVE STREAMING. The vision pipeline gives Claude Code continuous visual context, turning a text-based agent into a visually-aware system. This is about enabling persistent visual memory and contextual understanding across sessions. The "tool" is inference infrastructure - the real value is the continuous stream of contextual awareness that enables true human-AI collaboration through shared visual understanding.
