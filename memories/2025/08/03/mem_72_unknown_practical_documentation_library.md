# Memory 72

Practical Documentation Library Reorganization:
Created clear structure stepping back from consciousness framework:
1. DEVELOPMENT_LIBRARY_STRUCTURE.md - Clean directory organization (documentation/, development_tools/, research_notes/, project_resources/, code_library/, knowledge_base/, ledger/)
2. REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md - Mapping current chaos to organized structure
3. QUICK_NAVIGATION.md - Fast access commands and search patterns
4. RESOURCE_LEDGER.md - Central index tracking 574+ resources, quality metrics, usage stats
Focus: Practical development documentation serving as library/ledger for users and coding agents
