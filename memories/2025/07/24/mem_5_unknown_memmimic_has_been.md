# Memory 5

MemMimic has been successfully transformed into a nervous system architecture with 10 strategic tools: 3 nervous system triggers, 2 agent guidance tools, and 5 tales system tools. The biological reflex processing enables natural language triggers like 'recall', 'remember', and 'think' to automatically invoke enhanced intelligence processing.
