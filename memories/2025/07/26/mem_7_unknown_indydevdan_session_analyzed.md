# Memory 7

IndyDevDan session: Analyzed comprehensive 'Principled AI Coding' course materials. 8-lesson structure teaching spec-driven development, ADWs, Director Pattern. Key philosophy: 'The plan IS the prompt'. Tools: Aider (programmable AI coding assistant), UV (Python package manager). Advanced patterns: Spec prompts for massive code generation, AI Developer Workflows for automation, Director Pattern for closed-loop autonomous coding. Core principle: Moving from 'how' to 'what' in engineering.
