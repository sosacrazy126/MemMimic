### Entry 1: Task Status - COMPLETED
**Date:** 2025-07-17
**Agent:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Successfully implemented MemoryConsolidator for intelligent memory relationship management and duplicate prevention.

**Implementation Details:**
- ✅ Created `memory_consolidator.py` (580+ lines, comprehensive implementation)
- ✅ Multi-factor similarity analysis (content, semantic, temporal)
- ✅ Duplicate detection with 95% threshold
- ✅ Related memory grouping with configurable similarity thresholds
- ✅ Importance-aware consolidation preserving high-value memories
- ✅ Complete audit trail for all consolidation operations
- ✅ Integration with ActiveMemoryPool maintenance cycle
- ✅ Tested successfully with existing MemMimic database (4 memories analyzed, 37ms processing)

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Content similarity using Jaccard similarity and character-level analysis
- Semantic similarity based on memory type and CXD function matching
- Temporal proximity consideration for related memories
- Configurable consolidation thresholds and group size limits
- Safe schema migration for existing installations
- Performance optimized with proper indexing and caching

**Testing Results:**
- Successfully processed 4 memories in 37ms
- Schema automatically upgraded for existing database
- All consolidation tables and indexes created properly
- Integration with ActiveMemoryPool maintenance confirmed

**Outcome:** AMMS now has comprehensive memory consolidation capabilities, preventing duplicates and optimizing memory relationships across the entire pool.
