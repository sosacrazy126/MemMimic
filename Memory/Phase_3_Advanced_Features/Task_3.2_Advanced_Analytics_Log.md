### Entry 2: Task Status - IN PROGRESS
**Date:** 2025-07-18
**Agent:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4)
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Summary:** Beginning implementation of advanced analytics system based on strategic analysis. Starting with foundation components.

**Strategic Approach:**
Following Phase 3A approach: Advanced Analytics first to establish foundation before consciousness integration.

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Memory Pattern Analysis Engine** - Analyze temporal patterns in memory access and creation
2. **Importance Score Trend Tracker** - Monitor memory importance evolution over time
3. **Predictive Lifecycle Manager** - Forecast memory transitions and optimize proactively
4. **Advanced System Health Monitor** - Beyond basic performance to consciousness coherence indicators
5. **Analytics Dashboard** - Real-time visualization and insights

**Technical Architecture:**
- Build on existing AMMS performance monitoring foundation
- Leverage CXD classification for pattern recognition
- Integrate with enhanced MCP system for real-time metrics
- Create time-series analysis for trend tracking
- Implement predictive modeling for lifecycle management

**Current Focus:** Starting with Memory Pattern Analysis Engine implementation
