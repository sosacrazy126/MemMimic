# APM Project Memory Bank Directory

This directory houses the detailed log files for the MemMimic Active Memory Management System project.

## Structure:

Logs are organized into subdirectories corresponding to each Phase in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
Within each phase directory, individual `.md` files capture logs for specific tasks.

- `Phase_1_Integration_Testing/` - Integration & Testing phase logs
- `Phase_2_Performance_Validation/` - Performance & Validation phase logs  
- `Phase_3_Advanced_Features/` - Advanced Features phase logs

All log entries within these files adhere to the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.
